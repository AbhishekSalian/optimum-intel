# Stable Diffusion

The script [`run_diffusion.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/text-to-image/run_diffusion.py)
allows us to apply different quantization approaches (such as dynamic, static) using the [Intel Neural Compressor ](https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor) library for 
text to image tasks.

The following example applies post-training static quantization on a stable-diffusion with pretrained model:[lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers). In this example, we only quantize the unet model which is the performance critical in the diffusion pipeline, and the diffusion pipeline has four models: safety_checker, text_encoder, unet, vae. 

## Prepare 
### pretrained model
```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/lambdalabs/sd-pokemon-diffusers
```
Now, the models are in sd-pokemon-diffusers

### Ground Truth Images
In this case, we used FID metric to evaluate the model, so we should download [training datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions) and choose one image to a directory(like "base_images").
>**Note:** In this case we used picture: [Ground_Truth_Image](https://datasets-server.huggingface.co/assets/lambdalabs/pokemon-blip-captions/--/lambdalabs--pokemon-blip-captions/train/14/image/image.jpg).

## Quantization
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --model_name_or_path stable-diffusion-v1-4 \
    --apply_quantization \
    --quantization_approach static \
    --tolerance_criterion 0.02 \
    --verify_loading \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \   # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --calib_text "a drawing of a green pokemon with red eyes" # The prompt to calibrate for static quantization
```

In order to apply dynamic or static, `quantization_approach` must be set to respectively `dynamic` or `static`.

The configuration file containing all the information related to the model quantization can be 
specified using respectively `quantization_config`. If not specified, the default
[quantization](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel/blob/main/examples/neural_compressor/text-to-image/quantization.yml),
configuration files will be used.

The flag `--verify_loading` can be passed along to verify that the resulting quantized model can be loaded correctly.

The ground truth image:
![Ground Truth](images/ground_truth.jpg)

The image generated by original model(FID with ground truth: 333):
![FP32 Image](images/fp32.png)

The image generated by quantized UNet(FID with ground truth: 246):
![INT8 Image](images/int8.png)

## Performance
Original model
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \   # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark
```
The model of quantized UNet
```bash
python run_diffusion.py \
    --output_dir /tmp/diffusion_output \
    --base_images base_images \   # The path of the ground truth pictures
    --input_text "a drawing of a gray and black dragon" \
    --benchmark \
    --int8
```
>**Nonte:** The performance of quantized model will get 2.56X speedup in Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8375C CPU @ 2.90GHz with Tcmalloc and IOMP. The Tcmalloc and IOMP usage are in [Performance Tuning Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/cpu/latest/tutorials/performance_tuning/tuning_guide.html)
